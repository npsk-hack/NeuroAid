#### National Public School, Rajajinagar
Our app is to help diagnose Neuro-degenerative diseases in people. It is a disease that affects millions of people around the world and can go unnoticed for a while. We measure the movement speeds in people and how 'slow' they are becoming. Patients usually go to doctors without proper reports and with the help of our app, we can show that the movements of the patients is actually decreasing or not. This disease affects older people in large and proper medication is key to help them improve their movements. We will be developing the app using android studio.
